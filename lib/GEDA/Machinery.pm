=head1 NAME

GEDA::Machinery - Generation utilities for users of gEDA

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a set of Perl scripts and libraries for gEDA (L<http://www.geda-project.org/>). Currently, it is primarily composed of adaptations of original scripts by DJ Delorie (L<http://www.gedasymbols.org/user/dj_delorie/>) with substantial refactoring to facilitate understanding and modification. This includes modifications to support C<use warnings> and C<use strict>, change globals to object attributes, and minimize calls to external programs.
