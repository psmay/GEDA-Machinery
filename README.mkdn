# NAME

GEDA::Machinery - Generation utilities for users of gEDA

# DESCRIPTION

This is a set of Perl scripts and libraries for gEDA ([http://www.geda-project.org/](http://www.geda-project.org/)). Currently, it is primarily composed of adaptations of original scripts by DJ Delorie ([http://www.gedasymbols.org/user/dj\_delorie/](http://www.gedasymbols.org/user/dj\_delorie/)) with substantial refactoring to facilitate understanding and modification. This includes modifications to support `use warnings` and `use strict`, change globals to object attributes, and minimize calls to external programs.
